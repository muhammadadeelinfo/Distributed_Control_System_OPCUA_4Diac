# Crane model to realize semi-autonomous funcitons in material handling domain
# Introduction
In the modern era, the demand for fast and efficient products manufacturing is in-
creasing and for that purpose, autonomous and semi-autonomous working features
are required. In this scenario, Industry 4.0 can fulfill this demand. One part of the
Industry 4.0 is the reduced human involvement in the manufacturing process and im-
proved interconnection between the devices, and human verses devices. A distributed
control network can be created in which the devices can be controlled by a single
Human Machine Interaction (HMI) device. Nowadays, Industries demand for au-
tonomous and semi-autonomous features to have better working control and for the
ease of business together with more production capabilities. The main focus of this crane model is to introduce semi-autonomous functions for cranes used in material handling
domain for the transportation of the material from one place to another. Such kind
of cranes use sensors and actuators that move the crane and control the bridges,
trolleys, and hooks. All the devices in the distributed network are controlled with
one HMI device.
